Idea :When ever user generates a short Link, and then runs it in the browser, we have to get the longUrl from database and redirect the user to that link.

Create a build folder for client(npm run build)
Create a Flask Server and appropritae routes

Packages and files : 
gunicorn  = Package which helps to deploy the application in a virtual env.
server/procfile = Heroku
server/privatekey = firebase config file.
server/app/build = build folder fom react.
wsgi => Web Server Gateway Interface

#Deploying to Heroku
Add a heroku Project, login to CLI and add git remote.
Then use command git subtree push --prefix server herok
u master to only push the server folder as it already contains the client build.
